# UG-GETDIRECTED - DCIT 204 GROUP 20 (END OF COURSE GROUP PROJECT)

A java program that provides its users with the shortest possible routes from their chosen current locations to a preferred destination here on the University Of Ghana main campus.  

Locations of well-known landmarks within the school are moduled as vertices which are stored and connected to each other by edges in a graph. The edges of this graph are with weights which depicts the distances between one landmark (i.e., vertice) to another.

Various locations in the program are represented by an adjancency list.

Dijkstra's algorithm is then implemented to get from available paths or routes the shortest.
